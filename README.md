Frostburn's home is Marvin's Mountaintop in Masontown, West Virginia a short distance from Morgantown. Frostburn is held held over President Day weekend, in February.

Frostburn is a regional event that brings Burning Man's desert spirit to the winter tundra; a music and arts festival, filled with music, art, fire, dancing, food, and all manner of cold weather fun.

Since 2008, Frostburn has been creating unique ways to share our warmth with an ever growing group in a way that only Burners do.

We look forward to seeing you on the Tundra!
