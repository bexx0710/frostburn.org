Welcome to Frostburn!

Frostburn's home is Marvin's Mountaintop in Masontown, West Virginia a short distance from
Morgantown. 

Frostburn 2016 will once again be held over President Day weekend, in February.

Frostburn is a regional event that brings Burning Man's desert spirit to the
winter tundra; a music and arts festival, filled with music, art, fire, dancing,
food, and all manner of cold weather fun.

Since 2008, Frostburn has been creating unique ways to share our warmth with an
ever growing group in a way that only Burners do.

We look forward to seeing you on the Tundra!

Network Connectivity is spotty around Masontown and GPS routing sometimes chooses questionable roads use these
